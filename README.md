### Features (chronologically ordered)

 - Diffuse light
 - Multi-threading
 - Preview in BMP-format
 - Reflection
 - Blinn-Phong Shading
 - Specular highlights
 - Shadows
 - Multiple light sources
 - KD-Tree
 - Refraction
 - MSAA
 - Textures
 - Depth of Field
 - Smooth transition between reflection and refraction

### Debug features
 - Raytracing
    - 'r' to launch the multi-threaded RayTracer, rendering an image. 
    - 'R' to launch the RayTracer 5 times and calculate the average time of these runs.
 - Debug Ray
    - ' ' to shoot a debug ray through the scene, console output is plenty
     Will also draw all lines reflected and refracted in the scene.
     Known bug: first ray shot will always return a white color (1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
 - Lighting
    - 'L' to add a light source at the camera position
    - 'l' to move the last added light source to the camera position
    - 'c' to clear all light sources and add a light source at camera
 - Focal point
    - 'f' to set the focal point to the depth of the object the mouse is pointed at
(our final render is made without setting the focal point, as this was still a bit bugged)
 - Opening result
    - 'o' to open the result of the raytracing, 'result.bmp'.
     If opened before rendering, Windows Photo Viewer will refresh it when progress is written to the file.
    - 'O' to open the result of the Depth of Field post-processing, 'blurred.bmp'.
 - Save lights and camera position
    - 's' to save the current state of the camera and the light positions.
    - 'S' to load these settings back in the preview (warning: crashes if you haven't saved before)
 - Exit
    - 'Esc' to exit the program.


Special thanks goes out to hjmediastudios for the permission to use and adapt the Lego Soldier Object.

We did not use any code from the internet, except for an image reading library called Corona (library included with source-code). We did use formulas from Wikipedia, the course slides, and other Computer Graphics related websites.
